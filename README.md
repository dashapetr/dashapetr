### Hi there 👋

🔍 I am a Data Scientist with a focus on NLP/Classical ML/GenAI and a track record of delivering data-driven solutions. Over 4 years of experience in Data Science and more than 5 years in project management, adept at understanding end-users' business needs.

🎓 As a mentor for Data Specialists, I specialize in sharpening AWS cloud skills, empowering professionals to tackle challenges intelligently and excel in their roles. Coming from a non-developer background, I've personally experienced the journey of learning cloud computing from scratch.

🌐 My dedication to mastering AWS led me to become an AWS Community Builder, a title I proudly hold today. Additionally, I've achieved notable milestones, including winning hackathons, delivering engaging talks at User Groups, and being recognized as an "All Builders Welcome" grant recipient.
I am dedicated to fostering knowledge sharing within the community, helping others enhance their AWS skills.

💡 Passionate about unlocking the potential of data, my goal is to make data useful and impactful. I believe in the transformative power of AI to improve lives and achieve remarkable goals.
