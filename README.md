🔍 Data Scientist with a focus on NLP/Classical ML and a track record of delivering data-driven solutions. Over 4 years of experience in Data Science and more than 5 years in project management, adept at understanding end-users' business needs.

🎓 As a mentor for Data Specialists, I specialize in sharpening AWS cloud skills, empowering professionals to tackle challenges intelligently and excel in their roles. Coming from a non-developer background, I've personally experienced the journey of learning cloud computing from scratch.

I am dedicated to fostering knowledge sharing within the community, helping others enhance their AWS skills.

💡 Passionate about unlocking the potential of data, my goal is to make data useful and impactful. I believe in the transformative power of AI to improve lives and achieve remarkable goals.
